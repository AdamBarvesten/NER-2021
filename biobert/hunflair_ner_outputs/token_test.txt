using

seeking

also

If

as

N

relevant

and
since

have
a
worse

we
suggest
here
that
perhaps
such
tumors
are
resistant
to
control
by
N

cells
because
they
lack
the
ability
to
attract
an
accumulation
of

to
the

,
or
because
blocking

prevent
local

Using

analyses
,
we
determined
that
multiple
nuclear

bind

[SEP]

We
determined
that
an
in

sequence
present

an

sequence
are
required

[SEP]

We
also
demonstrate
that
the
My

zinc

)
appears
to
be
the
predominant
factor
binding
to
one

[SEP]

We
therefore
believe
that

is
also
likely
to
play
an
important
role
in

Using

the

allowed

To

we

,
in

[SEP]

Next
,
we
demonstrated
that
these

directly
up

regulated

upon
their

to
their

.
[SEP]

We
then
investigated
if
HC

also
resulted
in
the

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our

resulted

the

[CLS]
Because

have

we

we
